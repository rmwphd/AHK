Autohotkey scripts

**Script Name** - What it does

*Ordered from most useful and practical to most interesting*


**Universal Mouse Scroll** - Holding down right mouse button (configurable) allows you to scroll (vertically and horizontally!) as if with a scroll wheel by moving your mouse (or, in my case, trackball). 

**Terminal Paste** - Detects if your current window is a minnty window and, if it is, send Shift-Ins when you hit Ctrl-V and Ctrl-Ins when you hit Ctrl-C, allowing normal Windows-style copying and pasting in those windows.

**Better Clicker** - Changes Right Alt to Left Click. Useful for trackpads without buttons where the usual clicking behavior often moves the mouse a little bit, this script keeps you from having problems when trying to click very precisely by removing the click from the surface that moves the cursor. This is a ludicrously simple script and it does mess up the usual alt-left "go back" shortcut, but it's been very helpful for me on certain recent Dells.

**POK3R-Style Arrow Cluster** - Changes CapsLock to a layer key specifically allowing the i/j/k/l cluster up/left/down/right behavior that the POK3R 60% keyboard comes with standard (if you activate the CapsLock->Fn dipswitch).

**Scrolling Through Time** - Inspired by [this xkcd comic](https://www.xkcd.com/1806/), I wrote a quick script to turn my scroll wheel into a time machine for the open file, i.e., to send rapid streams of undo and redo commands to the current window. I've added a modifier, Alt, so I can keep it running without compromising other useful behaviors.

**DS4KB** - Allows use of a DualShock4 contoller as a pseudo-Workman-layout keyboard with layers! Just turn on Bluetooth, hold down the PS and Share buttons until the light bar starts flashing, pair it from your computer, and fire up the script!
