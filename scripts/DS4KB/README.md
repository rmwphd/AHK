# DS4KB

**DS4KB** lets you use a DualShock4 contoller as a keyboard with customizable layout and layers! Just turn on Bluetooth, hold down the PS and Share buttons until the light bar starts flashing, pair it via your computer, and fire up the script!

Layout files should be placed in the same directory as the main script and consist of layer definitions and are `include`d in the script to activate that particular layout.

Folder DS4KB-layouts contains hand-drawn vector DS4 layout diagrams for Workmanesque layout and a blank version, in SVG and exported PNG formats. You'll probably want to print out a blank or two if you're experimenting or add whatever layout you prefer and print that off as a reference, at least until you get used to where things are. 


I should look at the research on this page: http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization to come up with a really good layout for this style of typing device...
